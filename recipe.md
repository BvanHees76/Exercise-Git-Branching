# 5 INGREDIENT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE

## INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. Drain your chickpeas and pour the drained water into a clean bowl. Any grease will prevent your Aquafaba from whipping up!  
   Pop the chickpeas in your fridge for another mealâ€¦
2. With an electric whisk, whisk the Aquafaba on a slow speed, gradually increasing until it's on high.                
   Add the few drops of lemon juice to help the Aquafaba stabilise and whisk even quicker.      
   Whisk the Aquafaba for about 3 minutes until it's made stiff peaks and doesn't shift in the bowl.        
   At this point, add in your sugar, one tablespoon at a time and continue whisking until you have a thick, glossy, meringue like texture.
3. Melt your chocolate over a bain-marie and once the chocolate has completely melted, take it off the heat.
4. Add one third of the Aquafaba mixture into the hot chocolate and mix well.    
   Slowly fold in the rest of the Aquafaba mixture with a spatula. Do this carefully so the mousse doesn't deflate.
5. Transfer into ramekins and pop in the fridge to set!
